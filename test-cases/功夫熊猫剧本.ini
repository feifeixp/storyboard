031 What were you doing up there? All that noise. 
032 Nothing. I just had a crazy dream. 
033 About what? 
034 What were you dreaming about? 
035 What was I...? 
036 I was dreaming about... ...noodles. 
037 Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles? 
038 Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? 
039 Careful! That soup is sharp. 汤可能会割到舌头. 
040 Oh happy day! 
041 My son finally having the noodle dream! You don't know how long I've been waitin
g for this moment. 
03 当我年少轻狂，曾经想过做豆腐? 
043 This is a sign Po. 
044 A sign of what? 
045 You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredie
nt Soup. Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant! 
046 As I took it over from my father who took it over from his father... ...who won it fr
om a friend in mahjong. 
047 Dad Dad Dad it was just a dream. 
048 No it was the dream. 
049 We are noodle folk. Broth 面汤 runs through our veins. 
050 But Dad didn't you ever want to do something else? 
051 Something besides noodles? 
052 Actually when I was young and crazy I thought about running away 
and learning how to make tofu. 
053 Why didn't you? 
054 Because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine me makin Tofu. No! We all have o
ur place in this world. Mine is here and yours is...

subtlety. Mantis... 
060 - Master Shifu. 
061 - What?! 
062 It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. 
063 Master Oogway you summoned me? Is something wrong? 
064 Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend? 
065 So nothing's wrong?

067 You were saying? 你的意思是... 
068 I have had a vision. 预感. 
069 Tai Lung will return. 
070 That is impossible! He is in prison. 
071 Nothing is impossible. 
072 Zeng 阿正! Fly to Ohorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards double 
their weapons double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! 
073 Yes Master Shifu! 
074 One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. 世事难料 
越不想发生的 往往越会发生

076 He'll... 
077 Your mind is like this water my friend. 你的心如同水.

096 Selling noodles? But Dad I was thinking maybe I... 
097 - Yeah? 
098 - I was thinking maybe I... ...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad. 
099 That's my boy!(表扬自己孩子时候用的到这句)

177 You doubt my prison security?!

178 Absolutely not. 
179 Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. 
180 I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. Escape from Ohorh-Gom prison is imp
ossible! 
181 Lmpressive isn't it? 
182 It's very impressive. It's very impressive. 相当森严. 
183 One way in one way out. One thousand guards and one prisoner. 
184 Yes eXcept that prisoner... ...is Tai Lung.

193 Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you. 
194 Don't get him mad. 
195 What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized. 
196 Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail? 
197 I'm good. I've seen enough. 够的. 我看够多了. 
198 I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about. 
199 No he doesn't. 确实. 
200 I'll tell him that. 
201 Can we please go now? 
10 哇! 这是! 功夫神殿! 
202 Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! 
203 Wait a second! 
204 I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm... 
205 The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way! 哇! 这是! 功夫神殿! 
206 Look at this place. Master Flying Rhino's armor with authentic battle damage! The S
word of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking. The Invisible Tride

211 Sorry I should have come to you first. 
212 My patience is wearing thin. 我的耐性有限. 
213 Well I mean it's not like you were going anywhere. 
214 - Would you turn around? 
215 - Sure. 
216 How's it going? 
217 How do you get 5 000... 
218 Master Shifu! Someone... broke that. 
219 But I'll fiX it. Do you have some... ...glue? A splinter. 
11 我想是吧 
220 So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior? 
221 - I guess so. 
222 - Wrong! 
223 You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until... ...you
have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. 
224 So how does this work? Do you have a ladder or a trampoline or...? 
225 You think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret 
226 - to limitless power? 
226 - No I... 
228 (接 226 句)One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is impossible 
if that one is someone like you. 
229 Someone like me? 
230 Yes look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms! 
231 Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. 些肥厚的地方神经很敏感. 
232 And this ridiculous belly. 
233 And utter disregard for personal hygiene. 根本不讲究个人卫生 
234 Now wait a minute. That's uncalled for. 这些要求 
225 Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath. 
226 Listen Oogway said I was... The WuXi Finger Hold. 无极指法 
227 Not the WuXi Finger Hold! 
228 Oh you know this hold? 你知道这个指法? Developed by Master WuXi in the Third
Dynasty. 第三代功夫大师 无极 所创. 
229 Then you know what happens when I fleX my pinky. 弯弯尾指 
230 - No no! 
231 - You know the hardest part of this? 最难的地方是什么? 
232 The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards 
. 
12 我是零起点
233 OK OK take it easy. 
234 Now listen closely panda.

e going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear? 但你遇到我后你会希望他从没选过你! 听清楚了么?
 
236 Yeah we're clear. We're so clear. 
237 Good. 
238 I can't wait to get started. 
239 - Let's begin. 
240 - Wait wait wait. 
241 What? 
242 - Now? 
243 - Yes now. 
244 Unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior. 
245 Oh OK well... I don't know if I can do all of those moves. 所有招式. 
246 Well if we don't try we'll never know will we? 
247 Yeah it's just maybe we can find something more suited to my level. 
248 What level is that? 
249 Well I'm not a master but... ...let's just start at zero. Level zero. 
250 No. There is no such thing as level zero. 
251 - Maybe I can start with that. 
252 - That? 
253 We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot. 天热时让
门开着 用它顶住. But if you insist...

e the same. 
256 Go ahead panda. Show us what you can do.

15 你不属于这里

307 - Yeah.

309 We got big things tomorrow. 明天还要忙呢. 
310 All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

312 I didn't say anything. 
313 OK. All right. Good night. Sleep well. 
314 That seemed a little awkward. 有点儿尴尬. 
315 Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you. 
316 - You don't belong here. 
317 - Yeah of course. 
318 This is your room. 
319 I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu and if y
ou have any respect for who we are and what we do you will be gone by morning. 
320 Big fan! 崇拜你们! 
16 你不开心就找东西吃
321 I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. 神圣智慧的仙桃
树. 
322 Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree. 
323 I understand. You eat when you are upset. 我了解 你不开心就找东西吃. 
324 Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset. 
325 So why are you so upset? 
326 I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu. In the history o
f China. In the history of sucking! 
327 Probably. 
328 And the Five! Man you should've seen them! They totally hate me. 
329 Totally. 
330 How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? 师父怎么能把我变成
神龙大侠? 
331 I mean I'm not like the Five. I've got no claws no wings no venom. Even Ma
ntis has those... thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles. 
332 Quit don't quit. Noodles don't noodles. 
333 You are too concerned with what was and what will be. There's a saying: Yesterday 
is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. 
17 拉它上来!，等等，放它回去! 
334 - Oh no! 
335 - What's happening?! 
336 To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go! 
337 Fire crossbows! 
338 Fire! Fire!

339 Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu. 
340 - Not going anywhere! Neither is he! 
341 - Let go of me! 
342 Bring it up! 拉它上来! Wait! Bring it back! 放它回去! 
343 - He's coming this way! - 他往这边过来了! 
345 - He won't get far. Archers! 
346 We're dead. So very very dead. 我们死定了. 一定 一定的 死定. 
347 Not yet we're not. Now! 
348 - Can we run now? 
349 - Yes. 
350 I'm glad Shifu sent you. 
351 I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten. 
352 Fly back there and tell them... ...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home. 
 
18 我想我正在热身
352 Good morning Master! 
353 Panda! Panda! Wake up! 
354 He's quit. What do we do now with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Wa
rrior? 
355 All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time 不用多久 
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. 
356 What are you doing here?! 
357 Hi! Good morning Master! I thought I'd warm up a little. 
358 You're stuck. Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck? 
359 Nah. This is one of my... Yeah I'm stuck. 
360 - Help him. 
361 - Oh dear. 
362 Maybe on three. One two... ...three. 
363 - Thank you. 
364 - Don't mention it. 
365 - No really I appreciate... 
366 - Ever. 
19 真的大侠永不放弃
367 You actually thought you could learn to do a full split 霹雳腿 in one night? 
368 It takes years to develop one's fleXibility! And years longer 再好几年 to apply it in co
mbat 实战! 
369 Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken b
ones. 染血断指 或 爆裂骨头 
370 Yeah! EXcellent. 
371 Let's get started.

372 - Are you ready? 
373 - I was born re... 我准备好没 
374 I'm sorry brother. I thought you said you were ready. 
375 That was awesome! 太厉害了!Let's go again! 
376 I've been taking it easy on you panda. But no more. 熊猫 我一直手下留情. 现在
不会了. 
377 Your next opponent will be me. 
378 All right! Yeah let's go! 
379 Step forth. 上前一步. 
380 The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness... ...and make him suffer
for it. 
381 Oh yeah! 
382 To take his strength and use it against him... 用他的力量 反击到他身上......until he 
finally falls... ...or quits. 
383 A real warrior never quits. 
384 Don't worry Master. I will never quit! 
 
20 我不会以体型判断一个大侠
385 If he's smart he won't come back up those steps. 就别在回来了. 
386 But he will. He's not going to quit is he? 
387 He's not going to quit bouncing 满地打滚 I'll tell you that. 
388 I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better. 
389 Trust me it will. 
390 It's just not easy finding the right nerve points 穴位 under all this... 
391 - Fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur. 
392 Sure you were. 
393 Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me. 我不会以体型判断一个
大侠 
394 I'm over here. 在这里. 
395 Maybe you should look at this again. 
396 Oh OK. 
397 Stop it. Stop! 
 
21 师傅曾经笑过
398 I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all... ...but if I didn't know better I'd
say he was trying to get rid of me. 不知道的 还以为他故意虐待我想赶我走. 
399 I know he can seem kind of heartless... 他看上去很无情 ...but he wasn't always like 
that. 
400 According to legend 据说以前 there was once a time when Master Shifu actually use
d to smile. 
401 - No! 不可能! 
402 - Yes. But that was before.

403 Before what? 
404 Before Tai Lung. 
405 We're not really supposed 我们不应该提起他的. to talk about him. 
406 Well if he's going to stay here he should know. 
407 Guys guys 师兄们 I know about Tai Lung. 
408 He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu. 他是师父
的徒弟,第一个学会了师父的上千本领. 
409 And then he turned bad and now he's in jail. 
410 He wasn'tjust a student. Shifu found him as a cub... 在他襁褓时 师父收养了他... ...
and he raised him as his son. 
411 And when the boy showed talent in kung fu... ...Shifu trained him. 
412 He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness. 师父深信 他必成大
器. 
413 It was never enough for Tai Lung. 但太郎不满足.He wanted the Dragon Scroll. 
414 But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. 
415 Outraged Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. 狂怒的太郎 血洗和平谷. 
416 He tried to take the scroll by force 强夺.And Shifu had to destroy what he had create
d. 师父打算 亲自了断 他的一手栽培.But how could he? 
417 Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before. Or since. 
418 And now he has a chance to make things right. To train the true Dragon Warrior. A
nd he's stuck 结果却遇上你.with you. A big fat panda who treats it like a joke. 
419 That is it! 够了! 
420 Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve. And may have also stopped 
his heart. 
22 内心平和
421 Inner peace. 内心平和.Inner peace. Inner... Inner peace. 
422 Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?! 谁在拍东西 不能小声点
儿?! 
423 Inner... 
424 Oh Zeng. EXcellent. 
425 I could use some good news right now. 让我听听是什么好消息. 
426 Master! Master! 
427 I have... It's... It's very bad news. Shifu. 
428 There is just news. There is no good or bad. 
429 Master your vision. Your vision was right. 
430 Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way. 正赶过来. 
431 That is bad news... 
432 ...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. 
432 The panda? Master that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't meant 
to be here! It was an accident. 
433 There are no accidents. 
434 Yes I know. You've said that already. - Twice. 
PDF 文件使用 "pdfFactory Pro" 试用版本创建 www.fineprint.cn
435 - Well that was no accident either. 没错 不存在巧合. 
436 Thrice. 
23 看穿假象
437 My old friend the panda will never fulfill his destiny nor you yours until you let g
o of the illusion of control. 看穿假象. 
438 Illusion? 
439 Yes. Look at this tree Shifu. 
440 I cannot make it blossom when it suits me 我无法控制它按时开花 nor make it bear f
ruit before its time. 
441 But there are things we can control. I can control when the fruit will fall. And I can
control... ...where to plant the seed. 
442 That is no illusion Master. 
443 Yes. 
444 But no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree. 
445 You may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach. 
446 But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! 
447 Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it. To nurture it.To believe in it. 
448 But how? How? I need your help Master. 
449 No you just need to believe. 
450 Promise me Shifu. Promise me you will believe. 
451 I will try. 
452 Good. 
453 My time has come. You must continue yourjourney without me. 
454 What are you...? 你到底...? Wait! 
455 Master! You can't leave me! 
456 You must believe. 
457 Master! 
24 我想我的身体还不知道他是神龙大侠
458 Yeah so I'm like "Fine you may be a wolf 当时 我就骂“没错 你是一只狼 
459 you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province... 是海京省 最骇人的恶霸... ...but
you're a lousy tipper." ...但吝啬又小气 
460 Really? So how did you get out of there alive? 
461 I mean I didn't actually say that... 我当时没真的说出口... ...but I thought it... ...in
my mind. 心里骂 
461 If he could read my mind he'd be like "What?" 肯定大发雷霆 
462 Order up! 做好了! Hope you like it. 
463 - This is really good! - No come on. 算了吧 
464 Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup 祖传密制汤面.. He actually knows the secret ing
redient. 只有他知道配方. 
465 What do you mean? This is amazing! 惊叹

466 - You're a really good cook. 
467 - I wish my mouth was bigger. 
468 Tigress you've got to try this. 
469 It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of
ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe. 
470 I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. 
471 I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice. 
472 - What? 
473 - Nothing... Master Shifu. 
25 不减肥刷牙别想成神龙大侠
474 Never be 别指望 the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teet
h! 
475 What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! 
476 Work hard panda and maybe someday... ...you will have ears like mine. 
477 That's good. 
478 Ears. It's not working for you? 不好笑吗? I thought they were pretty good. 
479 It's Shifu! 
480 Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? 
481 Master Shifu! 
482 You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children! 
483 - What? 
484 - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll and you are the only one who can stop him. 
485 And I was saying you got no sense of humor. 
486 I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung. 
487 What? You're serious? And I have to...? Master Oogway will stop him 
like he did before. 
488 Oogway cannot! Not anymore. Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. 
489 - The panda? 
490 - Yes the panda! 
491 Master let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for. 
492 No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. 
493 It is his! 是他! 
26 没问题的 你是神龙大侠
494 Where'd he go? 
495 You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits. 绝不放弃. 
496 Watch me. 看看我. 
497 Come on. 算啦. 
498 How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. 
499 You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior. 
500 You don't believe that. 没问题的 你是神龙大侠. 
PDF 文件使用 "pdfFactory Pro" 试用版本创建 www.fineprint.cn
501 You never believed that. 
From the beginning you've tried to get rid of me. 
502 Yes! I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in m
ine. 
503 You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. 
504 Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone yet you stayed. 
505 Yeah I stayed. 
506 I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled it hur
t but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. 
507 I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me... ...could make me... not me...
...改造成...不是现在的我... 
508 ...it was you. ...就凭师父您. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China! 
509 But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! 
510 Come on 算了吧.. Tai Lung is on his way here right now. Even if it takes him a hu
ndred years to get here how are you... ...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior? 
27 我伤心我就吃，OK? 
510 How? 
511 How? 
512 - How?! - I don't know! 
513 I don't know. 
514 That's what I thought. 我很清楚. 
515 This is what you trained me for. 
516 Tigress! Don't try and stop me. 
517 We're not trying to stop you. 
518 What? 
519 We're coming with you! 
520 What? I eat when I'm upset OK? 
521 No need to eXplain. 
28 我意思是 你怎么爬上去的? 
522 I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. 
523 Don't tell Monkey. 
524 - Look at you. - 看看你. 
525 - Yeah I know I disgust you. - 呃 我知道你看不习惯. 
526 No I mean how did you get up there? 不 我意思是 你怎么爬上去的? 
527 I don't know. I guess that... 
528 I don't know. I was getting a cookie. 我只是为了拿饼干. 
529 Yet you are ten feet off the ground. And you have done a perfect spilt. 
530 No this? This is just... ...an accident. 
531 There are no accidents. Come with me.

532 I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey... 我知道你要教我功夫的奥
秘... 
533 ...but could you at least tell me where we're going? 
534 You dragged me... ...all the way out here... ...for a bath? 
535 Panda... ...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears. 
536 The Pool of... 
537 This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries... ...of harmony and focus. 宇宙玄机. 
538 This is the birthplace... ...of kung fu. Do you want to learn kung fu? 
539 Yeah! 
540 Then I am your master! 
541 OK! 
542 Don't cry. 
543 OK. 
544 When you focus on kung fu when you concentrate... ...you stink 你会很糟糕.Perhaps t
hat is my fault. 
29 我现在想到了教你的方法，用这个。。
545 I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get th
rough to you... ...is with this. 
546 Oh great 'cause I am hungry. 
547 Good. When you have been trained you may eat. 学武有成 才有吃. 
548 Let us begin. 
549 After you panda. 熊猫 你先. 
550 Just like that? 这么简单? 
551 No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike? 不用仰卧起坐? 不用跑十里路? 
552 I vowed to train you and you have been trained. You are free to eat. 
553 Enjoy. 
554 Hey! 
555 I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. 
556 Hey! 
558 You are free to eat. 
559 - Am I?! 
560 - Are you?! 
561 I'm not hungry. Master. 
562 Cut it! 砍断! 
30 神龙大侠在那里？
563 Where's the Dragon Warrior? 
564 How do you know you're not looking at her? 
565 You think I'm a fool? 
566 I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! 
PDF 文件使用 "pdfFactory Pro" 试用版本创建 www.fineprint.cn
567 I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire. That he's a warrior unlike anythi
ng the world has ever seen. 
568 - Po? 
569 - So that is his name. Po. 
570 Finally a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! 
571 We've got this. Help her. 
572 Monkey! Go! 
573 What was I thinking?! Mantis! Now! 
574 Shifu taught you well. But he didn't teach you everything. 
575 You have done well panda. 
576 Done well? Done well? I've done awesome! 
577 The mark of a true hero is humility. 谦虚. But yes you have done... 
...awesome. 
578 Guys? Guys?! They're dead! No they're breathing. They're asleep? 
But their eyes are open. 
31 我有点儿怕
579 We were no match for his nerve attach. 我们完全不是对手. He's gotten stronger. 
580 Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? 
581 He's too fast! Sorry Po. I thought we could stop him. 
582 He could have killed you. 
583 Why didn't he? 
584 So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work. 
585 It might. I mean a little. 或许. 我有点儿怕.I'm pretty scared. 
586 You can defeat him panda! 
587 Are you kidding? If they can't?! 
588 They're five masters. I'm just one me. 
589 But you will have the one thing that no one else does. 
590 You really believe I'm ready? 
591 You are... 
32 我能穿墙吗？
592 ...Po. Behold the Dragon Scroll. It is yours. 
593 Wait. What happens when I read it? 
594 Legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat. 
595 Really? That's cool. 
596 Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe 
in motion around you. 
597 Can I punch through walls? 
598 - Do a quadruple back flip? 连续四个后空翻? 
- Focus. - 专心. 
599 - Will I...?

600 - Focus. 
601 - Focus. 
602 - Oh yeah yeah. 
603 Read it Po and fulfill your destiny. 
604 Read it and become... ...the Dragon Warrior. 
605 It's impossible to open. 
606 OK. Come on baby. Come on now. 好的. 算了吧. 别这样. 
607 Thank you. 
608 I probably loosened it up for you though. 或者刚刚我已经弄松了. 
609 OK here goes. 好的 就是它了. 
33 无字秘籍
610 - It's blank. 
611 - What?! 
612 - Here look. 
613 - No I am forbidden to look upon... 
614 Blank. I don't... I don't understand. 
615 OK. So like... 
616 ...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all. 
617 No. Oogway was wiser than us all. 
618 Oh come on! Face it he picked me by accident. 
619 Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? 骗谁啊我? 
620 But who will stop Tai Lung? He'll destroy everything and everyone. 
621 No. Evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. 
622 - What about you Master? 
623 - I will fight him. 
624 - What? 
625 - I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. 
626 But Shifu he'll kill you. 
627 Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. 
628 Listen to me all of you. 
629 It is time for you to continue your journey without me. 
630 I am very proud to have been your master. 
631 We've got to get them out safely. Come little one. Let's find your mama. 
632 Viper gather the southern farmers 南部居民. Mantis the north. 
633 Orane light the way. 点灯 
34 秘方就是。。。什么也没有
634 Look it's the Dragon Warrior. 
635 Hey Dad.

636 Po! 
637 Good to have you back son. Good to be back. 
638 Let's go Po. So for our next shop it's time to face it... ...the future of noodles is d
ice-cut vegetables... ...no longer slices. Also I was thinking maybe this time we'll have a 
kitchen you can actually stand up in. 
639 You like that? 喜欢吗? 
640 Po I'm sorry if things didn't work out. 阿宝 抱歉 这么多事情没解决. 
641 It just wasn't meant to be. 本不应该这样的. 
642 Po forget everything else. 
643 Your destiny still awaits. We are noodle folk 面条世家. Broth runs deep through our 
veins. 
644 I don't know Dad. Honestly sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son. 
645 Po... 
646 ...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you......a long time ago. 
647 OK. 
648 The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup. Come here. The secret ingredient
is... ...nothing. 
649 You heard me. Nothing! There is no secret ingredient! 
650 Wait wait. It's just plain old noodle soup? 
651 You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? 
652 Don't have to. To make something special. you just believe it's special. 
653 There is no secret ingredient. 
 
35 不是你的错吗？
654 I have come home Master. 
655 This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. 
656 Oh yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this Po? Did I scare him off? 
657 This battle is between you and me. 
658 So that is how it's going to be. 行 如你所言. 
658 That is how it must be. 如我所愿. 
659 I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness! 
660 Obeying your master is not weakness! 
661 You knew I was the Dragon Warrior. You always knew. But when Oogway said othe
rwise what did you do? What did you do?! 
662 Nothing! 
663 You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! 
664 Not your fault?! Who filled my head with dreams?! Who drove me to train 
until my bones cracked?! Who denied me my destiny?! 
665 It was never my decision to make! 我从未做过这样的决定! 
666 It is now. Give me the scroll! 
667 I would rather die. 
668 All I ever did I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are Shifu! Te
ll me! Tell me!

669 I have... I have always been proud of you. From the first moment I've been... ..pro

were becoming... ...what I... ...was turning you into. I'm... I'm sorry. 
670 I don't want your apology. I want my scroll! 
671 What?!

698 No! 
699 Finally! Oh yes. 
700 The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine! It's nothing! 
701 It's OK. I didn't get it the first time either. 
702 What? 
703 There is no secret ingredient. 
704 It's just you. 
705 Stop it! I'm gonna pee. 
706 Don't. Don't! Don't!
